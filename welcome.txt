HOW TO PLAY & GAME MECHANICS

THE GOAL
Your objective is to match 3 or more candies of the same color in a row (horizontally or vertically). Each match increases your score and earns you gold to spend in the shop.

BASIC CONTROLS

Selection: Click or tap a candy to select it.

Swapping: Click/tap an adjacent candy (up, down, left, or right) to swap their positions.

Invalid Moves: If a swap doesn't result in a match-3 or better, the candies will slide back to their original spots.

SPECIAL ITEMS: THE CANDY BOMB

Spawning: Bombs have a 5% chance to appear whenever new candies drop onto the board.

Activation: Unlike regular candies, you don't swap bombs. Simply click or tap a Candy Bomb to detonate it.

Effect: The bomb explodes in a large radius, clearing all surrounding candies and awarding bonus points. This is perfect for clearing "deadlocks" or triggering massive chain reactions.

THE COMBO SYSTEM
When candies are cleared, new ones fall from the top. If these falling candies form new matches automatically, you trigger a "Combo." Every consecutive combo provides a score multiplier, making it the best way to hit top scores.

THE SHOP & PROGRESSION

Earning Gold: Every match you make on the board adds to your total gold count.

Customization: Visit the "Island Shop" from the main menu.

Unlockable Themes:

Default Island (Owned)

Candy Island (1,000 Gold)

Chocolate Island (2,500 Gold)

Gummy Island (5,000 Gold)

Equipping: Once purchased, you can "Equip" an island to change the game's background wallpaper.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS

Look for "L-shapes" or "T-shapes": Matching 4 or 5 candies at once doesn't just look cool; it maximizes your score density.

Save your Bombs: Don't use a bomb the moment it appears. Wait until you have a board layout that is hard to match, or use it to trigger a cascade of falling candies.

Check the Shop often: Changing your island theme can give the game a fresh feel as you aim for higher scores!
